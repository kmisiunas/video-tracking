KLab (v2): Particle Tracking using Mathematica
==============

Routines for detecting particles in diffusion experiments and extracting their sub-pixel positions. Code written in Mathematica 10.

## Structure

bin/ - contains all the finalised library
tests/ - contain tests for each routine
development/ - contains prototyping tools and code
practice_videos/ - it says what it does on the tin

## Usage



## ToDo

 -[ ] Need performance improvement for Subpixel localisation algorithms
 -[ ] Compression for assemblies
 -[ ] Method for storing unused particle positions in assemblies and retrieving all positions
 -[ ] Linking integration into UI
